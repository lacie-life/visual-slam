This cheatsheet is a 10-page reference in probability that covers a semester's worth of introductory probability.

The cheatsheet is based off of Harvard's introductory probability course, Stat 110. It is co-authored by former Stat 110 Teaching Fellow William Chen and Stat 110 Professor Joe Blitzstein.

### 2.0 / 2015-09-04

Contributor: Joe Blitzstein

Summary: A huge thanks goes to Professor Joe Blitzstein (@stat110) for his work in polishing up the cheatsheet, adding colors and figures, and officially using it in his Stat 110 class (which is the class that inspired this cheatsheet to begin with). The cheatsheet is now a joint work by William and Professor Blitzstein.

Added

* Figures
* Probability of an Intersection or Union
* Distributions in R Section
* Colors

Fixes

* Extensive polishing and rephrasing for clarity, consistency, and quality.

Moved

* Inequalities moved from the back reference sheet to inside the cheatsheet under "Distribution Properties"
* Some sections reordered

Removed

* Repeated definitions of PMF and CDF
* Calculating Probability (2) from Example Problems
* MGF -- Distribution Matching from Example Problems

### 1.1.1 / 2015-03-20

Removed

* Unused theorems and commands
* Left margins on descriptions

Major Fixes

* Fixed error in Law of Total Probability formula 

Merged

* Classic Problems is now merged into Example Problems
