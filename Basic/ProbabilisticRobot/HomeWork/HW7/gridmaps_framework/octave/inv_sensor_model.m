% Compute the log odds values that should be added to the map based on the inverse sensor model
% of a laser range finder.

% map is the matrix containing the occupancy values (IN LOG ODDS) of each cell in the map.
% scan is a laser scan made at this time step. Contains the range readings of each laser beam.
% robPose is the robot pose in the world coordinates frame.
% gridSize is the size of each grid in meters.
% offset = [offsetX; offsetY] is the offset that needs to be subtracted from a point
% when converting to map coordinates.
% probOcc is the probability that a cell is occupied by an obstacle given that a
% laser beam endpoint hit that cell.
% probFree is the probability that a cell is occupied given that a laser beam passed through it.

% mapUpdate is a matrix of the same size as map. It has the log odds values that need to be added for the cells
% affected by the current laser scan. All unaffected cells should be zeros.
