% Updates the belief, i. e., mu and sigma after observing landmarks, according to the sensor model
% The employed sensor model measures the range and bearing of a landmark
% mu: 2N+3 x 1 vector representing the state mean.
% The first 3 components of mu correspond to the current estimate of the robot pose [x; y; theta]
% The current pose estimate of the landmark with id = j is: [mu(2*j+2); mu(2*j+3)]
% sigma: 2N+3 x 2N+3 is the covariance matrix
% z: struct array containing the landmark observations.
% Each observation z(i) has an id z(i).id, a range z(i).range, and a bearing z(i).bearing
% The vector observedLandmarks indicates which landmarks have been observed
% at some point by the robot.
% observedLandmarks(j) is false if the landmark with id = j has never been observed before.
