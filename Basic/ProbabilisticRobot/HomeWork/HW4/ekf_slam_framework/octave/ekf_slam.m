% This is the main extended Kalman filter SLAM loop. This script calls all the required
% functions in the correct order.
%
% You can disable the plotting or change the number of steps the filter
% runs for to ease the debugging. You should however not change the order
% or calls of any of the other lines, as it might break the framework.
%
% If you are unsure about the input and return values of functions you
% should read their documentation which tells you the expected dimensions.
