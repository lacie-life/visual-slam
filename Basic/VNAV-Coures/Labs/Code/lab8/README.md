# Installation

1. Follow the instructions in the handout to install all the depenencies

2. Build lab_8:
```
catkin build lab_8
```

Remember to source your workspace:
```
source {VNAV_HOME}/vnav_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

# Usage

1. In this lab, we will be using different executables, one for each deliverable, and we are not using more than one node at a time, therefore we will just use rosrun.
To run rosrun, you need first to launch roscore in a terminal.
```
roscore
```
then, in another terminal run:
```
rosrun lab_8 deliverable_2
```
> **Note** Not so fast, first you have to implement the functions inside the source code, follow the handout at this point.
